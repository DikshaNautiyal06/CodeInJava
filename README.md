## Overview
This repository contains Java-based applications that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts. The projects included are:

1. **Number Guessing Game** - A simple console-based game where the user guesses a randomly generated number.
2. **Student Grade Calculator** - A program that calculates the average percentage and assigns a grade based on the student's marks.
3. **Currency Converter** - A graphical user interface (GUI) application for converting between Indian Rupees (INR) and US Dollars.

## Project Details

### 1. Number Guessing Game
- This is a command-line game where a random number is generated within a given range.
